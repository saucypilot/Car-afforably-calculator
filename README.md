### What is this program?
This program calculates how much you would need to afford a car. It basically tells you how much you need to make a year to afford any car you want, without sacrificng your quality of life.
### Why did I make this?
There are couple of reasons why I made this. First, I'm a car enthusiast and it's a very expensive hobby. A-lot mistakes I see within the car community is that people tend to sacrifice other areas of their lives just to afford a sports car they want. As much as I love cars, a persons health and finance should be prioirty. A person should only buy a car if it doesn't impact their life in a negative way.

Second, the economy isn't always so great. Not everyone has financial literacy to avoid mistakes. The program does all the work for the user and tells them if they can afford it.
